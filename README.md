# CPPOptimizations
Learning about C++ idioms and which ones are optimal. I've got a lot of ideas about writing faster code, but am I correct? In this repo I'll attempt to validate my ideas.

## Getting Started

I'll use CMake and CLion for this code. 

### Prerequisites

I'll try to stick with standard C++17 and Google Test. There will probably not be a main module, just unit tests. I'll provide instructions for those unit tests soon.


### Installing

After cloning the repo, simply open the project folder, create a build folder, and run 'cmake ..' from that build folder. You will be able to run the unit tests from the build folder. 

## Running the tests

TBD

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [CMake](https://cmake.org) - Use this to build the tests
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - My IDE of choice
* [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) - The test framework used

## Contributing

I'm happy for any contributions!

## Versioning

Just using git
